Covered by a few meters of salt crust, it has an extraordinary flatness with the average elevation variations within one meter over the entire area of the Salar. The large area, clear skies, and exceptional flatness of the surface make it an ideal object for calibrating the altimeters of Earth observation satellites."	),
